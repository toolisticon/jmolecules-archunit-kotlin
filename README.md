This repository is a **template repository** designed to be a template for the next project.

## How to use

* create a new repo on github (can be in any organization). Choose this project as template repository. Copy all branches, so the `master`exists in your repo (for the github actions)
* on the command line: clone your new repo locally
* in the `setup.sh` script: set your organization, repository and base package
* run the `setup.sh` script, all placeholders are filled with your information
* delete the setup-script
* Update the `README.md`
* in the `developers` section of the `pom.xml`: mention yourself ... it is your project.

## Things to change after usage of template

To change the following values, modify the placeholders in `setup.sh` and run it.
This is a one-time operation, you can safely delete the `setup.sh` file afterwards.

Of course, you can also edit manually .... and do not forget to change this `README.md` with YOUR project specific information :-).
